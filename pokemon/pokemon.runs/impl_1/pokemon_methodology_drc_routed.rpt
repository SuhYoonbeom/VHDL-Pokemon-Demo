2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -14.622 ns between u_battle/enemy_idx_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and u_vga/blue_out_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -15.904 ns between u_battle/enemy_idx_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and u_vga/blue_out_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.564 ns between u_battle/enemy_idx_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and u_vga/blue_out_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
