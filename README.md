## Project Overview
Our project recreates a simplified version of a Pokémon battle using VHDL and runs on a Nexys A7-100T FPGA board. The project is displayed on a monitor using a VGA to HDMI adapter plugged directly into the FPGA. The player is able to create a team of 3 Pokémon, choosing from 6 available Pokémon.
