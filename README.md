# VHDL Pokémon Battle Demo
*(For educational purposes only)*

**Made by Seongjun An and Matthew Suh**

## Project Overview
Our project recreates a simplified version of a Pokémon battle using VHDL and runs on a Nexys A7-100T FPGA board. The project is displayed on a monitor using a VGA to HDMI adapter plugged directly into the FPGA. The player is able to create a team of 3 Pokémon, choosing from 6 available Pokémon. The player then battles against a CPU trainer that also has a team of 3 Pokémon. The demo ends when the player defeats all of the CPU's Pokémon or when all of their Pokémon are defeated.
